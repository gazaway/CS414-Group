system administrator    (do last)
	- hire, promote, fire (can you change from an employee to a cook?)
customer interface; for editing profile  (NEXT JG TASK)
	- create, edit (login info / payment info?), cancel
manager interface
	- compPrice?  I think I'll actually put this in with the OrderInterface, would be more coherent that way. We'll just restrict its access
	              via the GUI
	- menu interface			(BB)
		create, edit, pricing?
